# SCB-Net
Spatially Constrained Bayesian Network (SCB-Net): An Approach to Obtaining Field Data-Constrained Predictive Maps with Uncertainty Assessment. In this project, we have developed an innovative approach to ensure that predicted lithologies accurately reflect the samples collected in the field. Moreover, our model leverages multisource remote sensing data to make predictions in areas where no direct samples are available. Our study focuses on the Churchill Province, located in Quebec, Canada.
